This page is only for my learning purpose!!!

:::

Nothing special I have to say or write for this *Solidworks C++ API* tutorials.

I will start posting on *Solidworks C++ API* tutorials along with ðŸš€ **[Solidworks VBA tutorials](/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks/)** on **casual basis** (Whenever I got time).

This section might be interested for:

 * *Those who want to learn Solidworks C++ API*

 * *Student doing Masters in CAD/CAM*

 * *Casual programmers like myself who want to apply what is learnt!*

One thing is sure, I am not going to explain in very detail because I am more of a **`.NET developer`** not a **`C++ Developer`**.

I just want to explore **C++ in Visual studio** and best way to do is writing some program using my existing knowledge of ***Solidworks C# API***.

So ***Solidworks C++ API*** posts are more "**how**" to type not much descriptive like ðŸš€ **[Solidworks VBA posts](/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks)**, which tends to describe in detailed manner.

That's it!

I hope you will like this and enjoy this section also.

Thank you!
