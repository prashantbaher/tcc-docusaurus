Nothing special I have to say or write for this *Solidworks C++ API* tutorials.

I will start posting on *Solidworks C++ API* tutorials along with [Solidworks VBA tutorials](/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks/) on **casual basis** (Whenever I got time).

For whom this section might be interested?

 * *Those who want to learn Solidworks C++ API*

 * *Student doing Masters in CAD/CAM*

 * *Casual programmers like myself who want to apply what is learnt!*

One thing is sure, I am not going to explain in very detail because I am more of a `.NET developer` not a `C++ Developer`.

I just want to explore **C++ in Visual studio** and best way to do is writing some program using my existing knowledge of ***Solidworks C# API***.

So ***Solidworks C++ API*** posts are more "**how**" to type not much descriptive like [Solidworks VBA posts](/solidworks-macros/vba-in-solidworks), which tends to describe in detailed manner.

That's it!!!

I hope you will like this and enjoy this section also.

Thanks!!!
