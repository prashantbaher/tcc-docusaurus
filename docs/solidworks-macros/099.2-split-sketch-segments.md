## Introduction

In this post, I tell you about **how to Split Open/Closed Sketch Entities using Solidworks VBA Macros** in a Sketch.

In this post, I explain about `SplitOpenSegment` and `SplitClosedSegment` method from **Solidworks** `SketchManager` object.

This method is ***most updated*** method, I found in *Solidworks API Help*. 

So ***use this method*** if you want to *Split Open/Closed Sketch Entities*.

---

## CASE 1 : Split Closed Sketch Entities 

Below is the `code` sample to *Split Closed Sketch Entities*.

```vb
Option Explicit

' Create variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Create variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

  ' Set Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Create string type variable for storing default part location
  Dim defaultTemplate As String

  ' Set value of this string type variable to "Default part template"
  defaultTemplate = swApp.GetUserPreferenceStringValue(swUserPreferenceStringValue_e.swDefaultTemplatePart)

      AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  End Select

  '----------------------------------------------------------------

End Sub
```

### Understanding Split Closed Sketch Segment the Code

Now let us walk through **each line** in the above code, and **understand** the meaning and purpose of every line.

I also give some link so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in **previous posts**.

```vb
Option Explicit
```

This line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 

For more information please visit **[Solidworks Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post.

```vb
' Create variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swApp` and the type of this `swApp` variable is `SldWorks.SldWorks`.

```vb
' Create variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swDoc` and the type of this `swDoc` variable is `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`.

```vb
' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean
```

In this line, we create a variable named `BoolStatus` as `Boolean` object type.

```vb
' Create variable for Solidworks Sketch Manager
Dim swSketchManager As SldWorks.SketchManager
```

In above line, we create variable `swSketchManager` for **Solidworks Sketch Manager**.

As the name suggested, a **Sketch Manager** holds variours methods and properties to manage *Sketches*.

To see methods and properties related to `SketchManager` object, please visit **[this page of Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2020/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager_members.html)**

```vb
' Create variable for Solidworks Sketch Segment
Dim swSketchSegment As SldWorks.SketchSegment
```

In this line, we Create a variable which we named as `swSketchSegment` and the type of this `swSketchSegment` variable is `SldWorks.SketchSegment`.

We create variable `swSketchSegment` for **Solidworks Sketch Segments**.

To see methods and properties related to `swSketchSegment` object, please visit **[this page of Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2020/English/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment_members.html)**

These all are our global variables.

As you can see in code sample, they are **Solidworks API Objects**.

So basically I group all the **Solidworks API Objects** in one place.

I have also place `boolean` type object at top also, because after certain point we will *need* this variable frequently.

Thus, I have started placing it here.

Next is our `Sub` procedure which has name of `main`. 

This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.

```vb
' Set Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

In this line, we set the value of our Solidworks variable `swApp`; which we define earlier; to Solidworks application.

```vb
' Create string type variable for storing default part location
Dim defaultTemplate As String
' Set value of this string type variable to "Default part template"
defaultTemplate = swApp.GetUserPreferenceStringValue(swUserPreferenceStringValue_e.swDefaultTemplatePart)
```

In 1st statement of above example, we are defining a variable of `string` type and named it as `defaultTemplate`.

This variable `defaultTemplate`, hold the location the location of **Default Part Template**.

In 2nd line of above example. we assign value to our newly define `defaultTemplate` variable.

We assign the value by using a *Method* named `GetUserPreferenceStringValue()`. 

This `GetUserPreferenceStringValue()` method is a part of our main Solidworks variable `swApp`.

```vb
' Set Solidworks document to new part document
Set swDoc = swApp.NewDocument(defaultTemplate, 0, 0, 0)
```

In this line, we set the value of our `swDoc` variable to new document.

For **detailed information** about these lines please visit **[Solidworks Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post.

I have discussed them **thoroghly** in **[Solidworks Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post, so do checkout that post if you want to understand above code in more detail.

```vb
'-----------------------UNIT CONVERSION----------------------------------------

' Local variables used as Conversion Factors
Dim LengthConversionFactor As Double
Dim AngleConversionFactor As Double

' Use a Select Case, to get the length of active Unit and set the different factors
Select Case swDoc.GetUnits(0)       ' GetUnits function gives us, active unit
  
  Case swMETER    ' If length is in Meter
    LengthConversionFactor = 1
    AngleConversionFactor = 1
  
  Case swMM       ' If length is in MM
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swCM       ' If length is in CM
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 100
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swINCHES   ' If length is in INCHES
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swFEET     ' If length is in FEET
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 * (0.0254 * 12)
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swFEETINCHES     ' If length is in FEET & INCHES
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254  ' For length we use sama as Inch
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swANGSTROM        ' If length is in ANGSTROM
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 10000000000#
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swNANOMETER       ' If length is in NANOMETER
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000000000
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swMICRON       ' If length is in MICRON
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000000
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
End Select

'----------------------------------------------------------------
```

Above code sample shows how to **fix Solidworks API Unit issue**. 

We *1st* get the *current unit* of the part and apply the *switch* statements to update our *Length and Angle Conversion factors*. 

I have already explained in detail about **Fixing Solidworks API Unit Issue** in **[General - Fix Unit Issue](/solidworks-macros/unit-correction)** blog post. 

Do checkout above post for Fixing Solidworks API Issue.

```vb
' Select Front Plane
BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Front Plane", "PLANE", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)
```

In above line, we select the *front plane* by using `SelectByID2` method from `Extension` object.

For more information about selection method please visit **[Solidworks Macros - Selection Methods](/solidworks-macros/select-plane-from-tree)** post.

```vb
' Set Sketch manager for our sketch
Set swSketchManager = swDoc.SketchManager
```

In above line, we set the *Sketch manager* variable to *current document's sketch manager*.

```vb
' Insert a sketch into selected plane
swSketchManager.InsertSketch True
```

In above line, we use `InsertSketch` method of *SketchManager* and give `True` value.

This method allows us to insert a sketch in selected plane.


```vb
' Create a circle of diameter 10
Set swSketchSegment = swSketchManager.CreateCircle(0, 0, 0, 10 * LengthConversionFactor, 0, 0)
```

In above line, we set the value of Solidworks Sketch Segment variable `swSketchSegment` by `CreateCircle` method from *Solidworks Sketch Manager*.

This `CreateCircle` method creates *a Circle* between "2 given point distance as diameter".

For more information about `CreateCircle` method, you can read my **[Solidworks Macro - Create Circle](/solidworks-macros/create-circle)** post.

That post describe all the parameters we need for this `CreateCircle` method in details.

In above line, we create a Circle with:

  - **Circle Centerpoint** : At origin i.e. *(0, 0, 0)*

  - **Circle Diameter** : **10** unit length

```vb
' Local variant type variable to hold return array of sketch segments
Dim swSketchSegmentArray As Variant
```

In above line of code, we create a `variant` type variable to hold return array of *sketch segments*.

```vb
' Spliting the circle created and store the return array into local variable
swSketchSegmentArray = swSketchManager.SplitClosedSegment(-10 * LengthConversionFactor, 0, 0, 10 * LengthConversionFactor, 0, 0)
```

For "**Spliting**" an *closed* sketch entity, we need `SplitClosedSegment` method from **Solidworks** `SketchManager` object.

This `SplitClosedSegment` method takes following parameters as explained:

  - **X1** : *X coordinate of first point.*

  - **Y1** : *y coordinate of first point.*

  - **Z1** : *z coordinate of first point.*

  - **X2** : *X coordinate of second point.*

  - **Y2** : *Y coordinate of second point.*

  - **Z2** : *Z coordinate of second point.*

After the function complete following are the results:

**Return Value**:

  - **Array Sketch Segments**: *Array of sketch segments of the now split formerly closed sketch skegment.*

In our code, I have used following values:

  - **X1** : *X coordinate of first point = `-10 * LengthConversionFactor`.*

  - **Y1** : *y coordinate of first point = `0`.*

  - **Z1** : *z coordinate of first point = `0`.*

  - **X2** : *X coordinate of second point = `10 * LengthConversionFactor`.*

  - **Y2** : *Y coordinate of second point = `0`.*

  - **Z2** : *Z coordinate of second point = `0`.*

Below image shows before and after Circular Sketch Pattern.

**Before Circular Sketch Pattern**

![close-segment-before-split](/assets/Solidworks_Images/split-sketch-segments/close-segment-before-split.png)

**After Circular Sketch Pattern**

![close-segment-after-split](/assets/Solidworks_Images/split-sketch-segments/close-segment-after-split.png)

```vb
' De-select the Sketch after creation
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

In the above line of code, we deselect the **Sketch** after the *Linear Sketch Pattern* operation.

For de-selecting, we use `ClearSelection2` method from our Solidworks document name `swDoc`.

```vb
' Show Front View after Linear Sketch Pattern
swDoc.ShowNamedView2 "", swStandardViews_e.swFrontView
```

In the above line of code, we update the *view orientation* to **Front View**.

In my machine, after inserting a sketch view orientation does not changed.

Because of this I have to update the view to **Front view**.

For showing **Front View** we used `ShowNamedView2` method from our Solidworks document name `swDoc`.

This method takes 2 parameter described as follows:

  - **VName** : Name of the view to display or an empty string to use ViewId instead

  - **ViewId** : ID of the view to display as defined by `swStandardViews_e` or -1 to use the **VName** argument instead.

*NOTE:* If you specify both **VName** and **ViewId**, then **ViewId** takes precedence if the two arguments do not resolve to the same view.

`swStandardViews_e` has following Standard View Types:

  - *swBackView*

  - *swBottomView*

  - *swDimetricView*

  - *swFrontView*

  - *swIsometricView*

  - *swLeftView*

  - *swRightView*

  - *swTopView*

  - *swExtendetricView*

In our code, we did not use **VName** instead I used *empty string* in form of ***""*** symbol.

I used **ViewId** value to specify view and used `swStandardViews_e.swFrontView` value to use *Standard Front View*.

```vb
' Zoom to fit screen in Solidworks Window
swDoc.ViewZoomtofit
```

In this last line we use *zoom to fit* command.

For Zoom to fit, we use `ViewZoomtofit` method from our Solidworks document variable `swDoc`.

Below is the `code` sample to *Split Open Sketch Entities*.

Now let us walk through **each line** in the above code, and **understand** the meaning and purpose of every line.

I also give some link so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in **previous posts**.

We *1st* get the *current unit* of the part and apply the *switch* statements to update our *Length and Angle Conversion factors*. 

I have already explained in detail about **Fixing Solidworks API Unit Issue** in **[General - Fix Unit Issue](/solidworks-macros/unit-correction)** blog post. 

Do checkout above post for Fixing Solidworks API Issue.

```vb
' Select Front Plane
BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Front Plane", "PLANE", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)
```

In above line, we select the *front plane* by using `SelectByID2` method from `Extension` object.

For more information about selection method please visit **[Solidworks Macros - Selection Methods](/solidworks-macros/select-plane-from-tree)** post.

```vb
' Set Sketch manager for our sketch
Set swSketchManager = swDoc.SketchManager
```

In above line, we set the *Sketch manager* variable to *current document's sketch manager*.

```vb
' Insert a sketch into selected plane
swSketchManager.InsertSketch True
```

In above line, we use `InsertSketch` method of *SketchManager* and give `True` value.

This method allows us to insert a sketch in selected plane.


```vb
' Create a line of distance 10
Set swSketchSegment = swSketchManager.CreateLine(0, 0, 0, 10 * LengthConversionFactor, 0, 0)
```

In above line, we set the value of Solidworks Sketch Segment variable `swSketchSegment` by `CreateLine` method from *Solidworks Sketch Manager*.

This `CreateLine` method creates *a line* between "2 given point".

For more information about `CreateLine` method, you can read my **[Solidworks Sketch Macro - Create Line](/solidworks-macros/sketch-create-line)** post.

That post describe all the parameters we need for this `CreateLine` method in details.

In above line, we create a line of 10 unit in X-direction.

```vb
' Local variant type variable to hold return array of sketch segments
Dim swSketchSegmentArray As Variant
```

In above line of code, we create a `variant` type variable to hold return array of *sketch segments*.

```vb
' Spliting the line at distance of 5 and store the return array into local variable
swSketchSegmentArray = swSketchManager.SplitOpenSegment(5 * LengthConversionFactor, 0, 0)
```

For "**Spliting**" an *closed* sketch entity, we need `SplitOpenSegment` method from **Solidworks** `SketchManager` object.

This `SplitOpenSegment` method takes following parameters as explained:

  - **X** : *X coordinate of the point that splits the sketch segment in two.*

  - **Y** : *y coordinate of the point that splits the sketch segment in two.*

  - **Z** : *z coordinate of the point that splits the sketch segment in two.*

After the function complete following are the results:

**Return Value**:

  - **Array Sketch Segments**: *Array of sketch segments of the now split formerly closed sketch skegment.*

In our code, I have used following values:

  - **X** : *X coordinate of the point that splits the sketch segment in two = `5 * LengthConversionFactor`.*

  - **Y** : *y coordinate of the point that splits the sketch segment in twot = `0`.*

  - **Z** : *z coordinate of the point that splits the sketch segment in two = `0`.*

Below image shows before and after Circular Sketch Pattern.

**Before Circular Sketch Pattern**

**After Circular Sketch Pattern**

[![open-segment-after-split](/assets/Solidworks_Images/split-sketch-segments/open-segment-after-split.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/split-sketch-segments/open-segment-after-split.png)

```vb
' De-select the Sketch after creation
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

In the above line of code, we deselect the **Sketch** after the *Linear Sketch Pattern* operation.

For de-selecting, we use `ClearSelection2` method from our Solidworks document name `swDoc`.

```vb
' Show Front View after Linear Sketch Pattern
swDoc.ShowNamedView2 "", swStandardViews_e.swFrontView
```

In the above line of code, we update the *view orientation* to **Front View**.

In my machine, after inserting a sketch view orientation does not changed.

Because of this I have to update the view to **Front view**.

For showing **Front View** we used `ShowNamedView2` method from our Solidworks document name `swDoc`.

This method takes 2 parameter described as follows:

  - **VName** : Name of the view to display or an empty string to use ViewId instead

  - **ViewId** : ID of the view to display as defined by `swStandardViews_e` or -1 to use the **VName** argument instead.

*NOTE:* If you specify both **VName** and **ViewId**, then **ViewId** takes precedence if the two arguments do not resolve to the same view.

`swStandardViews_e` has following Standard View Types:

  - *swBackView*

  - *swBottomView*

  - *swDimetricView*

  - *swFrontView*

  - *swIsometricView*

  - *swLeftView*

  - *swRightView*

  - *swTopView*

  - *swExtendetricView*

In our code, we did not use **VName** instead I used *empty string* in form of ***""*** symbol.

I used **ViewId** value to specify view and used `swStandardViews_e.swFrontView` value to use *Standard Front View*.

```vb
' Zoom to fit screen in Solidworks Window
swDoc.ViewZoomtofit
```

In this last line we use *zoom to fit* command.

For Zoom to fit, we use `ViewZoomtofit` method from our Solidworks document variable `swDoc`.
