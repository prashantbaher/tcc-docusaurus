## Objective

In this article, we understand "how to" **Delete Mate** in **Assembly document** from VBA macro.

You can use this method to **Delete any feature**, I just use it for deleting selected mate.

## Results We Can Get

Below image shows the result we get.

[![assembly-delete-mate](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-delete-mate/final-result-gif.gif)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-delete-mate/final-result-gif.gif)

We **Delete Mate** in simple manners.

There are no extra steps required.

To get the correct result, please follow the steps correctly.

## VBA Macro

Below is the ***VBA macro*** for *Delete Mate*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit

' Variable for Solidworks Application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Variable for Solidworks Assembly
Dim swAssembly As SldWorks.AssemblyDoc

' Variable for Solidworks Mate Feature
Dim swMateFeature As SldWorks.Feature

' Program to Delete selected feature
Sub main()

  ' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
  Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
  
  ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
  If swDoc Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Solidworks document is not opened."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Set Solidworks Assembly document
  Set swAssembly = swDoc
  
  ' Get mate feature
  Set swMateFeature = swDoc.Extension.GetLastFeatureAdded

  ' Check if successfully Get feature
  If swMateFeature Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Failed to Get feature."
    swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Select the mate
  swMateFeature.Select True
  
  ' Delete selected item
  swDoc.EditDelete
  
End Sub
```

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisites* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ‚ùó***required***.

* We use existing parts in Assembly document.

* Both components are fully constraint as shown in below image.

[![prerequisite](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-delete-mate/prerequisite.gif)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-delete-mate/prerequisite.gif)

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write, should be **error free** mostly.

## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Global Variables*
3. *Get Feature Data*
4. *Delete Mate*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

I also give some ***links (see icon üöÄ)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.
{: .notice}

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: üöÄ **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks Assembly
Dim swAssembly As SldWorks.AssemblyDoc
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Assembly*.
* **Variable Name**: `swAssembly`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.AssemblyDoc`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc_members.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks Mate Feature
Dim swMateFeature As SldWorks.Feature
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Mate Feature*.
* **Variable Name**: `swMateFeature` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.Feature`.
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Program to Delete selected feature
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *main Program to Delete selected feature*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information üöÄ **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Global Variables

In this section, we initialize global variables.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use üöÄ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and üöÄ **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks Assembly document
Set swAssembly = swDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swAssembly`** variable.
* This *value* is **`swDoc`** variable.

### Get Feature Data

In this section, we *Get Feature Data*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Get mate feature
Set swMateFeature = swDoc.Extension.GetLastFeatureAdded
```

* In above line, we set the value of variable **`swMateFeature`** by **`GetLastFeatureAdded`** method.
* This **`GetLastFeatureAdded`** method is part of **`Extension`** object.
* This **`Extension`** object is then part of **`swDoc`** object.
* **`GetLastFeatureAdded`** method gives us last added mate.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if successfully Get mate
If swMateFeature Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox "Failed to Get Mate."
  swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully get **Last Mate** or not.
* We use üöÄ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swMateFeature Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and üöÄ **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to Get Mate*.
  * After that we clear the selection.
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Select the mate
swMateFeature.Select True
```

* In above line we select the mate by **`Select`** method.
* This **`Select`** method take either **`True`** or **`False`**.
  * **`True`**: *Appends the feature to the current selection list.*
  * **`False`**: *Replaces the current selection list.*

### Delete Mate

In this section, we *Delete Mate*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Delete selected item
swDoc.EditDelete
```

* In above code block, *we Delete Selected item* i.e. selected mate.
* For this we set the value **`EditDelete`** method of **`swDoc`** variable.

* **Reference**: For more details please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2~EditDelete.html)**.


* **Return Value** : This **`EditDelete`** method did not return anything.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we get **Modified Distance Mate** as shown in below image.
