## VBA Macro

Below is the ***VBA macro*** for *Insert Virtual Part*.

```vb
Option Explicit

' Variable for Solidworks Application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Variable for Solidworks Assembly
Dim swAssembly As SldWorks.AssemblyDoc

' Variable for Solidworks Component
Dim swComponent As SldWorks.Component2

' Variable for Solidworks Face
Dim swFace As SldWorks.Face2

' Program to Insert virtual part
Sub main()
  
  ' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
  Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
  
  ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
  If swDoc Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Solidworks document is not opened."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Set Solidworks Assembly document
  Set swAssembly = swDoc
  
  ' Get the selected face and set it to the Solidworks Face variable
  Set swFace = swDoc.SelectionManager.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)
  
  ' Insert Virtual part
  swAssembly.InsertNewVirtualPart swFace, swComponent
  
  ' If there are error
  If swComponent Is Nothing Then
    ' Inform user and exit function.
    MsgBox "Failed to add Virtual part."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
End Sub
```

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisites* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ‚ùó***required***.
* We use existing parts in Assembly document.
* Both components are fully constraint as shown in below image.
* One face is selected, in which we want to insert virtual component.

[![prerequisite](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-insert-virtual-part/prerequisite.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-insert-virtual-part/prerequisite.png)

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write, should be **error free** mostly.

## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Global Variables*
3. *Insert Virtual Part*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

I also give some ***links (see icon üöÄ)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.
{: .notice}

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: üöÄ **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks Assembly
Dim swAssembly As SldWorks.AssemblyDoc
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Assembly*.
* **Variable Name**: `swAssembly`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.AssemblyDoc`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IAssemblyDoc_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks Component
Dim swComponent As SldWorks.Component2
```

* **Purpose**:  In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Component*.
* **Variable Name**: `swComponent` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.Component2`.
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2_members.html)**.

```vb
' Variable for Solidworks Face
Dim swFace As SldWorks.Face2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Face*.
* **Variable Name**: `swFace` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.Face2`.
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFace2_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb
' Program to Insert virtual part
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *main Program to Insert virtual part*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information üöÄ **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Global Variables

In this section, we initialize global variables.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use üöÄ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and üöÄ **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb
' Set Solidworks Assembly document
Set swAssembly = swDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swAssembly`** variable.
* This *value* is **`swDoc`** variable.

### Insert Virtual Part

In this section, we *Insert Virtual Part*.

```vb
' Get the selected face and set it to the Solidworks Face variable
Set swFace = swDoc.SelectionManager.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)
```

* In above code block, we get set the value of **`swFace`** variable.
* We use **`GetSelectedObject6`** method of **`swDoc.SelectionManager`** object.

```vb
' Insert Virtual part
swAssembly.InsertNewVirtualPart swFace, swComponent
```

* In above code, we **Insert Virtual part** into assemly.
* For this, we use **`InsertNewVirtualPart`** method.
* This **`InsertNewVirtualPart`** method is part of **`swAssembly`** variable.
* This method takes 2 parameter.
  * **FaceOrPlaneToSelect**: *Plane or planar face.*
  * **InsertedComponent**: *New part inserted as virtual component.*

* **Return Value** : This `InsertNewVirtualPart` method return üëâ **[Error as defined by swInsertNewPartErrorCode_e](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/swconst/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.swconst.swInsertNewPartErrorCode_e.html)**.

* In our code, I have used following values:

  | Parameter Name  | Value Used   |
  | --------------- | ------------ |
  | **FaceOrPlaneToSelect**        | `swFace`       |
  | **InsertedComponent**          | `swComponent`  |

* **Reference**: For more details please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks~solidworks.interop.sldworks.iassemblydoc~insertnewvirtualpart.html)**.

```vb
' If there are error
If swComponent Is Nothing Then
  ' Inform user and exit function.
  MsgBox "Failed to add Virtual part."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully added **Virtual Part** or not.
* We use üöÄ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swComponent Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and üöÄ **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to add Virtual part.
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we get **a New Virtual Part** as shown in below image.
