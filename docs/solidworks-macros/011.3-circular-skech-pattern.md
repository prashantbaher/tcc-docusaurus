## For Experience Macro Developers

If you are an experience **Solidworks Macro developer**, then you are looking for a specific code sample.

Below is the code for **Circular Sketch Pattern** from **Solidworks VBA Macro**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean

' Select Circle we want to Pattern
BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Arc1", "SKETCHSEGMENT", 0, 0, 0, True, 1, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)

' Create a Circular Sketch Pattern
BoolStatus = swSketchManager.CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat(0.5, 0, 3, 1, True, "", True, True, True)
```

**Method Name**: `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat`

**Description**: Create *Linear Sketch Pattern* of the selected sketch entity or entities.

**Prerequisites**: To create a **Linear Sketch Pattern** a Solidworks Sketch entity or entities, first we need following things:

  1. Sketch Entity/Entities to *Pattern*

  2. That Entity/Entities is selected before pattern

**How it works**:

  - For **Circular Sketch Pattern**, first you need to **Create** a variable of `Boolean` type.

  - After creating variable, you need to set the value of this `Boolean` variable.

  - For this you used `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method from **Solidworks Sketch Manager**.

  - This `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method set the value of `Boolean` type variable.

  - If the *Circular Sketch Pattern* is **successful** then `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method return **True** value otherwise `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` returns **False** value.

This `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method takes following parameters as explained:

  - **ArcRadius** : *Radius for the circular sketch pattern.*

  - **ArcAngle** : *Angle relative to the sketch entities being patterned.*

  - **PatternNum** : *Total number of instances, including the seed geometry.*

  - **PatternSpacing** : *Spacing between pattern instances.*

  - **PatternRotate** : *True to rotate the pattern, false to not.*

  - **DeleteInstances** : *Number of instances to delete, passed as a string in the format: "(a) (b) (c)".*

  - **RadiusDim** : *True to display the radius dimension in the graphics area, false to not.*
  
  - **AngleDim** : *True to display the angle dimension between axes in the graphics area, false to not.*

  - **CreateNumOfInstancesDim** : *True to display the number of instances dimension in the graphics area, false to not.*

If you want more detailed explaination then please read further otherwise this will help you to create a **Circular Sketch Pattern**.

## For Beginner Macro Developers

In this post, I tell you about `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method from **Solidworks** `SketchManager` object.

This method is ***most updated*** method, I found in *Solidworks API Help*. 

So ***use this method*** if you want to create *Circular Sketch Pattern*.

Below is the `code` sample to create *Circular Sketch Pattern*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit

' Create variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Create variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean

' Create variable for Solidworks Sketch Manager
Dim swSketchManager As SldWorks.SketchManager

' Create Variable for Solidworks Sketch Segment
Dim swSketchSegment As SldWorks.SketchSegment

' Main function of our VBA program
Sub main()

  ' Set Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Create string type variable for storing default part location
  Dim defaultTemplate As String

  ' Set value of this string type variable to "Default part template"
  defaultTemplate = swApp.GetUserPreferenceStringValue(swUserPreferenceStringValue_e.swDefaultTemplatePart)

  ' Set Solidworks document to new part document
  Set swDoc = swApp.NewDocument(defaultTemplate, 0, 0, 0)

  ' Select Front Plane
  BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Front Plane", "PLANE", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)

  ' Set Sketch manager for our sketch
  Set swSketchManager = swDoc.SketchManager

  ' Insert a sketch into selected plane
  swSketchManager.InsertSketch True
  
  ' Set Sketch Segment value and Create a Circle
  Set swSketchSegment = swSketchManager.CreateCircleByRadius(0, 0, 0, 0.2)
  
  ' De-select the lines after creation
  swDoc.ClearSelection2 True

  ' Select Circle we want to Pattern
  BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Arc1", "SKETCHSEGMENT", 0, 0, 0, True, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)
  
  ' Create a Circular Sketch Pattern
  BoolStatus = swSketchManager.CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat(0.5, 0, 3, 1, True, "", True, True, True)
  
  ' De-select the Sketch Segment after Circular Sketch Pattern
  swDoc.ClearSelection2 True

  ' Show Front View after Circular Sketch Pattern
  swDoc.ShowNamedView2 "", swStandardViews_e.swFrontView
  
  ' Zoom to fit screen in Solidworks Window
  swDoc.ViewZoomtofit2

End Sub
```

### Understanding the Code

Now let us walk through **each line** in the above code, and **understand** the meaning and purpose of every line.

I also give some link so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous posts.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit
```

This line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 

:::tip
For more information please visit ðŸš€ **[Solidworks Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post.
:::

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swApp` and the type of this `swApp` variable is `SldWorks.SldWorks`.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swDoc` and the type of this `swDoc` variable is `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean
```

In this line, we create a variable named `BoolStatus` as `Boolean` object type.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create variable for Solidworks Sketch Manager
Dim swSketchManager As SldWorks.SketchManager
```

In above line, we create variable `swSketchManager` for **Solidworks Sketch Manager**.

As the name suggested, a **Sketch Manager** holds variours methods and properties to manage *Sketches*.

To see methods and properties related to `SketchManager` object, please visit ðŸš€ **[this page of Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2017/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchManager_members.html)**

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create variable for Solidworks Sketch Segment
Dim swSketchSegment As SldWorks.SketchSegment
```

In this line, we Create a variable which we named as `swSketchSegment` and the type of this `swSketchSegment` variable is `SldWorks.SketchSegment`.

We create variable `swSketchSegment` for **Solidworks Sketch Segments**.

To see methods and properties related to `swSketchSegment` object, please visit ðŸš€ **[this page of Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/English/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchSegment_members.html)**

These all are our global variables.

As you can see in code sample, they are **Solidworks API Objects**.

So basically I group all the **Solidworks API Objects** in one place.

I have also place `boolean` type object at top also, because after certain point we will *need* this variable frequently.

Thus, I have started placing it here.

Next is our `Sub` procedure which has name of `main`. 

This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks variable to Solidworks application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

In this line, we set the value of our Solidworks variable `swApp`; which we define earlier; to Solidworks application.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create string type variable for storing default part location
Dim defaultTemplate As String
' Set value of this string type variable to "Default part template"
defaultTemplate = swApp.GetUserPreferenceStringValue(swUserPreferenceStringValue_e.swDefaultTemplatePart)
```

In 1st statement of above example, we are defining a variable of `string` type and named it as `defaultTemplate`.

This variable `defaultTemplate`, hold the location the location of **Default Part Template**.

In 2nd line of above example. we assign value to our newly define `defaultTemplate` variable.

We assign the value by using a *Method* named `GetUserPreferenceStringValue()`. 

This `GetUserPreferenceStringValue()` method is a part of our main Solidworks variable `swApp`.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks document to new part document
Set swDoc = swApp.NewDocument(defaultTemplate, 0, 0, 0)
```

In this line, we set the value of our `swDoc` variable to new document.

:::tip
For **detailed information** about these lines please visit ðŸš€ **[Solidworks Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post.

I have discussed them **thoroghly** in ðŸš€ **[Solidworks Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post, so do checkout that post if you want to understand above code in more detail.
:::

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Select Front Plane
BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Front Plane", "PLANE", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)
```

In above line, we select the *front plane* by using `SelectByID2` method from `Extension` object.

:::tip
For more information about selection method please visit ðŸš€ **[Solidworks Macros - Selection Methods](/solidworks-macros/select-plane-from-tree)** post.
:::

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Sketch manager for our sketch
Set swSketchManager = swDoc.SketchManager
```

In above line, we set the *Sketch manager* variable to *current document's sketch manager*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Insert a sketch into selected plane
swSketchManager.InsertSketch True
```

In above line, we use `InsertSketch` method of *SketchManager* and give `True` value.

This method allows us to insert a sketch in selected plane.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Sketch Segment value and Create a Circle
Set swSketchSegment = swSketchManager.CreateCircleByRadius(0, 0, 0, 0.2)
```

In above line, we set the value of Solidworks Sketch Segment variable `swSketchSegment` by `CreateCircleByRadius` method from *Solidworks Sketch Manager*.

This `CreateCircleByRadius` method creates *a Circle* at given point with radius.

:::tip
For more information about `CreateCircleByRadius` method, you can read my ðŸš€ **[Solidworks Macro - Create Circle By Radius](/solidworks-macros/create-circle-by-radius)** post.
:::

That post describe all the parameters we need for this `CreateCircleByRadius` method in details.

In above line, we create a Circle with:

  - **Circle Centerpoint** : At origin i.e. *(0, 0, 0)*

  - **Circle Radius** : *0.2*

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' De-select the lines after creation
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

After creating the circle we *de-select* it.

:::info NOTE
We **don't need** to de-select the circle for **Pattern** as we will select the circle agains in next line. I just want to show you how to select a **Sketch Segment** with `SelectById` Menthod in next line of code.
:::

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Select Circle we want to Pattern
BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Arc1", "SKETCHSEGMENT", 0, 0, 0, True, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)
```

In above line of code, we select the Circle i.e. **Arc 1** and add it to selection list.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create a Circular Sketch Pattern
BoolStatus = swSketchManager.CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat(0.5, 0, 3, 1, True, "", True, True, True)
```

In above line, we **Pattern** selected *Circle* by `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method from *Solidworks Sketch Manger* variable.

This `CreateCircularSketchStepAndRepeat` method takes following parameters as explained:

  - **ArcRadius** : *Radius for the circular sketch pattern. This value is in radian.*

  - **ArcAngle** : *Angle relative to the sketch entities being patterned. This value is in radian.*

  - **PatternNum** : *Total number of instances, including the seed geometry.*

  - **PatternSpacing** : *Spacing between pattern instances. This value is in radian.*

  - **PatternRotate** : *True to rotate the pattern, false to not.*

  - **DeleteInstances** : *Number of instances to delete, passed as a string in the format: "(a) (b) (c)".*

  - **RadiusDim** : *True to display the radius dimension in the graphics area, false to not.*
  
  - **AngleDim** : *True to display the angle dimension between axes in the graphics area, false to not.*

  - **CreateNumOfInstancesDim** : *True to display the number of instances dimension in the graphics area, false to not.*

After the function complete following are the results:

**Return Value**:

  - **True**: *If Circular Sketch Pattern is *Success*.*

  - **False**: *If Circular Sketch Pattern is *Fail*.*

**Circular Sketch Pattern Parameter**

Below image shows Circular Sketch Pattern Parameter.

![circular-sketch-pattern-parameters](/assets/Solidworks_Images/sketch-patterns/circular-sketch-pattern-parameters.png)

In our code, I have used following values:

  - **ArcRadius** : *I have used **0.5** value, Radius for the circular sketch pattern.*

  - **ArcAngle** : *I have used **0** value, Angle relative to the sketch entities being patterned.*

  - **PatternNum** : *I have used **3** value, Total number of instances, including the seed geometry.*

  - **PatternSpacing** : *I have used **1** value, Spacing between pattern instances.*

  - **PatternRotate** : *I have used **True** value, to rotate the pattern.*

  - **DeleteInstances** : *I have used **""** i.e. **empty string** value number of instances to delete.*

  - **RadiusDim** : *I have used **True** value, to display the radius dimension.*
  
  - **AngleDim** : *I have used **True** value, to display the angle dimension between axes.*

  - **CreateNumOfInstancesDim** : *I have used **True** value, display the number of instances dimension.*

Below image shows before and after Circular Sketch Pattern.

:::tip NOTE

It is ***very important*** to remember that, when you give distance or any other numeric value in **Solidworks API**, Solidworks takes that numeric value in ***Meter only***.

Please see below for detail:

  - Length: **Meter**

  - Angle: **Radian**

Solidworks API does not care about your application's Unit systems.

For example, I works in **ANSI** system means *inches* for distance. 

But when I used **Solidworks API** through *VBA macros or C#*, I need to converted numeric values.

Because Solidworks API output the distance in **Meter** which is not my requirement.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' De-select the Sketch after creation
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

In the above line of code, we deselect the **Sketch** after the *Circular Sketch Pattern* operation.

For de-selecting, we use `ClearSelection2` method from our Solidworks document name `swDoc`.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Show Front View after Circular Sketch Pattern
swDoc.ShowNamedView2 "", swStandardViews_e.swFrontView
```

In the above line of code, we update the *view orientation* to **Front View**.

In my machine, after inserting a sketch view orientation does not changed.

Because of this I have to update the view to **Front view**.

For showing **Front View** we used `ShowNamedView2` method from our Solidworks document name `swDoc`.

This method takes 2 parameter described as follows:

  - **VName** : Name of the view to display or an empty string to use ViewId instead

  - **ViewId** : ID of the view to display as defined by `swStandardViews_e` or -1 to use the **VName** argument instead.

:::info NOTE
If you specify both **VName** and **ViewId**, then **ViewId** takes precedence if the two arguments do not resolve to the same view.
:::

`swStandardViews_e` has following Standard View Types:

  - *swBackView*

  - *swBottomView*

  - *swDimetricView*

  - *swFrontView*

  - *swIsometricView*

  - *swLeftView*

  - *swRightView*

  - *swTopView*

  - *swExtendetricView*

In our code, we did not use **VName** instead I used *empty string* in form of ***""*** symbol.

I used **ViewId** value to specify view and used `swStandardViews_e.swFrontView` value to use *Standard Front View*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Zoom to fit screen in Solidworks Window
swDoc.ViewZoomtofit
```

In this last line we use *zoom to fit* command.

For Zoom to fit, we use `ViewZoomtofit` method from our Solidworks document variable `swDoc`.

This is it !!!

If you found anything to add or update, please let me know on my e-mail.

## VBA Language feature used in this post

In this post used some features of **VBA programming language**.

This section of post, has some brief information about the VBA programming language specific features.

1. We use **Option Explicit** for capturing un-declared variables. If you want to read more about **Option Explicit** then please visit ðŸš€ **[Declaring and Scoping of Variables](/vba/vba-declaring-and-scoping-of-variables)**.

2. Then we create **variable** for different data types. If you know in detail about the **Variables**, then please visit ðŸš€ **[Variables](/vba/vba-variables)** and ðŸš€ **[Data-types](/vba/vba-programming-concepts/#data-types-in-vba)** posts of this blog. It will help you to understand what **Variables** are and how to use them.

3. Then we create **main Sub procedure** for our macro. If you know in detail about the **Sub procedure**, then I suggest you to visit ðŸš€ **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/vba-sub-and-function-procedure)** and ðŸš€ **[Executing Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/vba-executing-procedures)** posts of this blog. It will help you to understand what **Procedures** are and how to use them.

4. In most part we create some variables and set their values. We set those values by using some **functions** provided from objects. If you don't know about the **functions**, then you should visit ðŸš€ **[VBA Functions](/vba/vba-functions)** and ðŸš€ **[VBA Functions that do more](/vba/vba-more-function)** posts of this blog. It will help you to understand what **functions** are and how to use them.
