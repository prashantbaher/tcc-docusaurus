This is most updated method of **Hiding selected Component** in an assembly document.

## Results We Can Get

Below image shows the result we get.

[![assembly-hide-component](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-hide-component/final-result-gif.gif)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-hide-component/final-result-gif.gif)

We **Hide selected Component** in simple manners.

There are no extra steps required.

:::caution
To get the correct result, please follow the steps correctly.

## VBA Macro

Below is the ***VBA macro*** for *Hide selected Component*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit

' Variable for Solidworks Application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks

' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2

' Variable for Solidworks Component
Dim swComponent As SldWorks.Component2

' Program to Hide Selected Component part
Sub main()
  
  ' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
  Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
  
  ' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
  Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
  
  ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
  If swDoc Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Solidworks document is not opened."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Get the selected component and set it to the Solidworks Component variable
  Set swComponent = swDoc.SelectionManager.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)

  ' If there are error
  If swComponent Is Nothing Then
    ' Inform user and exit function.
    MsgBox "Failed to get selected part."
    Exit Sub
  End If
  
  ' Select the component
  swComponent.Select False
  
  ' Hide selected component
  swDoc.HideComponent2
  
End Sub
```

## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisites* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ‚ùó***required***.
* We use existing parts in Assembly document.
* Both components are fully constraint as shown in below image.
* We select the part which we want to Hide.

:::info
We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write, should be **error free** mostly.

## Steps To Follow

This **VBA macro** can be divided into following sections:

1. *Create Global Variables*
2. *Initialize Global Variables*
3. *Hide selected Component*

***Every section with each line is explained below.***

:::tip
I also give some ***links (see icon üöÄ)*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.

### Create Global Variables

In this section, we create global variables.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit
```

* **Purpose**: Above line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 
* **Reference**: üöÄ **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** article.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks application*.
* **Variable Name**: `swApp`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SldWorks`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISldWorks_members.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks document*. 
* **Variable Name**: `swDoc` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IModelDoc2_members.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks Component
Dim swComponent As SldWorks.Component2
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Component*.
* **Variable Name**: `swComponent` 
* **Type**: `SldWorks.Component2`.
* **Reference**: Please visit üöÄ **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IComponent2_members.html)**.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Program to Hide Selected Component part
Sub main()

End Sub
```

* In above line, we create *Program to Hide Selected Component part*.
* This is a **`Sub`** procedure which has name of **`main`**. 
* This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.
* **Reference**: Detailed information üöÄ **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/vba-sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initialize Global Variables

In this section, we initialize global variables.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks Application variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks document variable to currently opened document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use üöÄ **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and üöÄ **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS document is not opened.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

### Hide selected Component

In this section, we perform *Hide selected Component* action.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Get the selected face and set it to the Solidworks Face variable
Set swComponent = swDoc.SelectionManager.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swComponent`** variable.
* We set the value from **`GetSelectedObject6`** method.
* This **`GetSelectedObject6`** method is part of **`SelectionManager`** object.
* This **`SelectionManager`** object is part of swDoc object.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' If there are error
If swComponent Is Nothing Then
  ' Inform user and exit function.
  MsgBox "Failed to get selected part."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swComponent`** variable.
* We use üöÄ **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swComponent Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and üöÄ **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to get selected part.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Select the component
swComponent.Select False
```

* In above line, we *select the component*.
* We use **`Select`** method of **`swComponent`** variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Hide selected component
swDoc.HideComponent2
```

* In above line, we Hide selected component.
* We use **`HideComponent2`** method of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This method return nothing.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we hide selected component as shown in below image.
