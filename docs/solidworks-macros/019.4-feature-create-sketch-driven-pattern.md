## Prerequisite

There are some *prerequisite* for this article.

* Knowledge of **VBA programming language** is ❗***required***.
* We are **not** creating feature from code but we use existing 🚀 **[Extrude feature](/solidworks-macros/create-extrude-feature)** and 🚀 **[Sketch Points](/solidworks-macros/create-point/)** to create **Sketch Driven pattern feature**.

*Below image shown prerequisite 3D model for our demo.*

[![prerequisite](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-sketch-driven-pattern/prerequisite.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-sketch-driven-pattern/prerequisite.png)

As shown in above image, there are ***2 Extrude features*** in our part.

- `Base Feature` : This is our **Base Extrude feature**.
- `Feature To Pattern` : This is our **feature for pattern**.


If you want to create these **Extrude** features and **Sketch Points** ***programmatically*** then please refer to below article.

* 🚀 **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Create Extrude/Boss](/solidworks-macros/create-extrude-feature)**
* 🚀**[Solidworks Macro - Create a Point](/solidworks-macros/create-point/)**

We will apply checks in this article, so the code we write should be error free most of the time.

* **Reference**: Detailed information 🚀 **[VBA Sub and Function Procedures](/vba/sub-and-function-procedure/)** article of this website.

### Initializing Required Variables

Inside this section we initialize required variables.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Setting Solidworks variable to current application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swApp`** variable.
* This *value* is currently opened Solidworks application.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Solidworks is opened or not
If swApp Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks is not opened")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swApp`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swApp Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *SOLIDWORKS is not opened*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Setting Solidworks document variable to opened part document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swDoc`** variable.
* This *value* is currently *opened part document*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Solidworks document is not opened. Please open a document.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully set the value of **`swDoc`** variable.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swDoc Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Solidworks document is not opened. Please open a document.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Solidworks Selection Manager variable
Set swSelMgr = swDoc.SelectionManager
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swSelMgr`** variable.
* This *value* is current document's *Selection Manager*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Array of Solidworks Entities
Dim swObjects(1 To 2) As SldWorks.Entity
```

* In above line, we create an 🚀 **[Array](/vba/arrays/)** of *Solidworks Entities*.
* **Variable Name**: `swObjects`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.Entity`
* **Length of Array**: *(1 To 2)*
* **Reference**: Please visit
  * **For Solidworks Entities**: 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IEntity_members.html)**.
  * **For Arrays in VBA** : 🚀 **[Array on this website](/vba/arrays/)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Local variable for selection
Dim selectItems As Integer
selectItems = 1
```

* In above line, we create a variable for selection and set its value.
* **Variable Name**: `selectItems`
* **Type**: `Integer`
*  **Value**: **`1`**

### Ask user to select feature and directions

In this section, we ask user to select **Feature and Sketch** for *Sketch Driven Pattern feature*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Loop till we select all entities
While selectItems <= 2

Wend
```

* In above line of code we start a `While` loop.
* We loop until `selectItems` variable's value is equal to **2**.
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[VBA Looping](/vba/looping/)** article from this website.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Message to show user
Dim messageToUser As String
```

* In above line, we create a variable to show a messages we want to show before selection.
* **Variable Name**: `messageToUser`
* **Type**: `String`

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Update Messages
Select Case selectItems
  Case 1
    messageToUser = "Please select a Feature for Pattern."
  Case 2
    messageToUser = "Please select a sketch for Pattern."
  Case Else
    Exit Sub
End Select
```

* In above code block, we use a `Select` statement to update message.
* We use the `case` on `selectItems`.
  * **Case 1**: `messageToUser` update to `"Please select a Feature for Pattern."`
  * **Case 2**: `messageToUser` update to `"Please select a sketch for Pattern."`
* **Reference**:  🚀 **[Select statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/#select-case-example)** article of this website.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Show message to user
MsgBox messageToUser
```

* In above line, we show the message to user.
* Below image shows the message for **Feature selection** to the user.

[![message-to-select-feature-for-sketch-driven-pattern](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-sketch-driven-pattern/message-to-select-feature-for-sketch-driven-pattern.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-sketch-driven-pattern/message-to-select-feature-for-sketch-driven-pattern.png)

* Below image shows the message for **Sketch selection** to the user.

[![message-to-select-sketch-for-sketch-driven-pattern](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-sketch-driven-pattern/message-to-select-sketch-for-sketch-driven-pattern.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-sketch-driven-pattern/message-to-select-sketch-for-sketch-driven-pattern.png)

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Loop until we complete our selection
While swObjects(selectItems) Is Nothing
    
Wend
```

* In above line, we create another `While` loop.
* This loops continues to run until we select the our **Feature** and **Edge** for circular pattern.
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[VBA Looping](/vba/looping/)** article from this website.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Local integer for loop
Dim i As Integer
```

* In above line, we create a variable as a counter.
* **Variable Name**: `i`
* **Type**: `Integer`

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Loop until we select
For i = 1 To swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectCount2(-1)

Next
```

* In above line, we create a `For` loop.
* This loops start from `i = 1` to number of `objects` we select.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Update Messages
Select Case selectItems

End Select
```

* In above line, we use a `Select` statement for selection entities.
* We use the `case` on `selectItems`.
* **Reference**:  🚀 **[Select statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/#select-case-example)** article of this website.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Case 1
	' If the profile sketch is selected
  If swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelBODYFEATURES Then

    ' Set the Solidworks Entity object to feature for Linear pattern
    Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)

    ' If the face is selected
  ElseIf swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelFACES Then

    ' Inform user to select feature from Feature Tree
    MsgBox "Please select Feature from Feature Tree."

    ' Clear selection
    swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  End If
```

* Above code block we use for **`Case 1`**.
* In above code block, we use  🚀 **[IF/ElseIf statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  with conditions.
* The  🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is `True` when selected `object` is type of ***SOLIDWORKS Body Feature***.
* Similarly,  🚀 **[ElseIf statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is `True` when select `object` is type of ***SOLIDWORKS Face***.

When we select the sketch from Model view, then selected object is *SOLIDWORKS Face*.

When we select the sketch from Feature Tree, then select object is *SOLIDWORKS Body Feature*.
{: .notice}

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set the Solidworks Entity object to feature for Linear pattern
Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)
```

* When  🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is **`True`** we run above line.
* In above line, we set the object inside array.
  * *Array of SOLIDWORKS Entities* = `swObjects`
  * *Indexed Entity Object* = `swObjects[selectItems]`
* **Indexed Entity Object** value set by `GetSelectedObject6()` method.
  * `GetSelectedObject6()` method is part of **SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager**.
  * **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr~GetSelectedObject6.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Inform user to select feature from Feature Tree
MsgBox "Please select feature from Feature Tree."

' Clear selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

* When 🚀 **[ElseIf statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is **`True`** we execute run above lines.
* **1st Line**: We show a message to user to select **Feature** from *Feature Tree*.
* **2nd Line**: After that we clear our selection.

We do this because if selected object type is *SOLIDWORKS Face* then we can not assign this object as SOLIDWORKS Entity inside array.
{: .notice}

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Case 2
  ' If the sketch is selected
  If swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelSKETCHES Then
  
    ' Set the Solidworks Entity object to sketch
    Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)
	
  ' If the feature is selected
  ElseIf swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(i, -1) = swSelectType_e.swSelBODYFEATURES Then
    ' Inform user to select sketch from Tree
    MsgBox "Please select Sketch from Feature Tree."

    ' Clear selection
    swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  End If
```

* Above code block we use for **`Case 2`**.
* In above line, we use  🚀 **[IF/ElseIf statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  with *conditions*.
* 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is `True` when selected `object` is type of *SOLIDWORKS Sketch*.
* Similarly,  🚀 **[ElseIf statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)**  is `True` when select `object` is type of **SOLIDWORKS Body**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set the Solidworks Entity object to selected sketch
Set swObjects(selectItems) = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(i, -1)
```

* When 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is `True` we execute code given below.
* In above line, we set the indexed object inside array.
  * *Array of SOLIDWORKS Entities* = `swObjects`
  * *Indexed Entity Object* = `swObjects[selectItems]`
* **Indexed Entity Object** value set by `GetSelectedObject6()` method.
  * `GetSelectedObject6()` method is part of **SOLIDWORKS Selection Manager**.
  * **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectionMgr~GetSelectedObject6.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Inform user to select sketch from Tree
MsgBox "Please select Sketch from Feature Tree."

' Clear selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

* When 🚀 **[ElseIf statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** is `True` we execute code given below.
* **1st Line**: We show a message to user to select **Sketch**. 
* **2nd Line**: We clear our selection.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
DoEvents
```

* After `For` loop end, we have a call for **`DoEvents`** function.
* This function repeats the `While` loop until we complete **Feature or Sketch** selection.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Clear previous selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True

' Increase the selection count
selectItems = selectItems + 1
```

* **1st Line**: We clear previous selection.
* **2nd Line**: Increment the **`selectItems`** count by 1.

After increment the selected count we continue our `while` loop.

### Mark selected Entities

In previous section, we complete our selection.

In this section, we complete **Select and Mark entities** correctly from our Array.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Local variable for counter
Dim j As Integer
j = 1
```

* In above line, we create a variable as a counter.
* **Variable Name**: `j`
* **Type**: `Integer`
* **Value**: **`1`**

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Loop till counter is 2, since we have 2 selection
While j < 3

Wend
```

* In above line, we create a `while` loop.
* **Condition**: that *counter value* of **`j`** should be *less than 3.*
* **Reference**: 🚀 **[VBA Looping](/vba/looping/)** article from this website.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set the current instance to Solidworks Entity variable
Set swObject = swObjects(j)
```

* In above line, we set the SOLIDWORKS Entity variable to current object from array.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create Select data for this entity
Set swSelData = swSelMgr.CreateSelectData
```

* In above line, we create SOLIDWORKS Select Data for current SOLIDWORKS Entity object.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Update Messages
Select Case j

End Select
```

* In above line of code, we use a `Select` statement for selection entities.
* We use the `case` on `j`.
* **Reference**:  🚀 **[Select statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/#select-case-example)** article of this website.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Case 1
  ' For feature to pattern, set mark to 4
  swSelData.Mark = 4
```

* Above code block, we use for **`Case 1`**.
* In above lines, we set **Mark** to **`4`**.
* For ***Sketch Driven Pattern*** feature, **`Mark`** values can be follows:

| Any...   | Must be preselected and marked with a value of... |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature  | 4                                                 |
| Points   | 32                                                |
| Sketches | 64                                                |
| Faces    | 128                                               |
| Bodies   | 256                                               |

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Case 2
  ' For sketch, set mark to 64
  swSelData.Mark = 64
```

* Above code sample we use for **`Case 2`**.
* In above lines, we update the **Mark** to **`64`**.
* For ***Sketch Driven Pattern*** feature, **`Mark`** values can be follows:

| Any...   | Must be preselected and marked with a value of... |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature  | 4                                                 |
| Points   | 32                                                |
| Sketches | 64                                                |
| Faces    | 128                                               |
| Bodies   | 256                                               |

* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[Sketch Driven Pattern feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPatternFeatureData.html)** in *SOLIDWORS API Help*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Select the current entity
swObject.Select4 True, swSelData
```

* In above line, we select the object.
* We select it by using `Select4` method of *SOLIDWORKS Entity object*.
* This method takes 2 arguments.
  * **Append** - *`True` appends the entity to the selection list, `False` replaces the selection list with this entity.*
  * **Data** - *Pointer to the **`ISelectData`** object.*
* We use following values as parameter.
  * **Append** - **`True`**
  * **Data** - **`swSelData`**

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
j = j + 1
```

After **`Select`** statement, we increment the counter variable **`j`** by **1**.

### Create Sketch Driven Pattern Feature Definition 

In this section we create  🚀 *[Sketch Driven Pattern feature Definition](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPatternFeatureData.html)* and set its properties for **Sketch Driven Pattern**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create Sketch pattern feature data
Set swLocalSketchPatternFeat = swDoc.FeatureManager.CreateDefinition(swFmSketchPattern)
```

* In above line of code we set the value of variable `swLocalSketchPatternFeat` by `CreateDefinition` method.
* `CreateDefinition` method is part of `FeatureManager` object.
* `FeatureManager` is again part of `swDoc` variable i.e. `ModelDoc2` object.
This `CreateDefinition` method takes following parameters as explained:
  - **Type** - *`Feature name ID` as defined in `swFeatureNameID_e`*.
    - `swFmBoundingBox` *(bounding box)*
    - `swFmCirPattern` *(circular pattern)*
    - `swFmCurvePattern` *(curve-driven pattern)*
    - `swFmDerivedLPattern` *(derived-driven pattern)*
    - `swFmDimPattern` *(variable/dimension pattern)*
    - `swFmFillPattern` *(fill pattern)*
    - `swFmGroundPlane` *(ground plane)*
    - `swFmLibraryFeature` *(library)*
    - `swFmLocalChainPattern` *(chain component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalCirPattern` *(circular component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalCurvePattern` *(curve-driven component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalLPattern` *(linear component pattern)*
    - `swFmLocalSketchPattern` *(sketch-driven component pattern)*
    - `swFmLPattern` *(linear pattern)*
    - `swFmNormalCut` *(sheet metal normal cut)*
    - `swFmRefCurve` *(projection curve)*
    - `swFmRefSurface` *(surface sweep)*
    - `swFmSketchPattern` *(sketch-driven pattern)*
    - `swFmSweep` *(boss sweep)*
    - `swFmSweepCut` *(cut sweep)*
    - `swFmSweepThread` *(Thread)*
    - `swFmTabAndSlot` *(tab and slot)*
    - `swFmTablePattern` *(table pattern)*

* **Return Value** : This `CreateDefinition` method return **feature or pattern-specific** feature data object.
* In our code, I have used following values:
    * **Type** - *I use `swFmSketchPattern` as `Feature name ID`*.

### Create Sketch Driven Pattern

In this section, we create Sketch Driven Pattern.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create Sketch pattern feature
Set swFeature = swDoc.FeatureManager.CreateFeature(swLocalSketchPatternFeat)
```

* In above line, we set the value of variable `swFeature` by `CreateFeature` method.
* This `CreateFeature` method takes following parameters as explained:
    * **FeatureData** - *`Feature or pattern-specific` feature data object*.
* **Return Value** : This `CreateFeature` method return 👉 **[Feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks~SOLIDWORKS.Interop.sldworks.IFeature.html)** data object.
  * `CreateFeature` method is part of `FeatureManager` object.
  * This `FeatureManager` is again part of `swDoc` variable i.e. `ModelDoc2` object.

* **Reference**: 🚀 **[online Solidworks API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeatureManager_members.html)** for Solidworks Feature Manager `FeatureManager`.

* In our code, I have used following values:
    * **FeatureData** - *I use `swLocalSketchPatternFeat` as feature data object which we defined previously*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Sketch pattern Feature creates or not
If swFeature Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("Failed to create Sketch pattern Feature.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully create 🚀 **[Sketch Driven Pattern Feature](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISketchPatternFeatureData.html)** or not.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swFeature Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to create Circular Pattern.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

### Final work

In this section, after creating **Sketch Driven Pattern** feature, we have to do some cleaning work so that we can use this macro frequently.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Erase array data
Erase swObjects
```

* In above line, we **erase** data from *SOLIDWORKS Entity array*.
* For this we use **`Erase`** function in-build in VBA.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' View zoom to fit
swDoc.ViewZoomtofit2
```

* In above line, we make our view zoom to fit the model.
* For this we use `ViewZoomtofit2` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Clear all selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

* In above line, we clear all previous selection.
* For this we use `ClearSelection2` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.
