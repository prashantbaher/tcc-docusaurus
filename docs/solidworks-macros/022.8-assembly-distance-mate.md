## Objective

<AdComponent />

In this article we **create and understand** VBA macro of adding **Distance Mate** in **Assembly document** of *SOLIDWORKS CAD Software*.

This method is ***most updated*** method, so ***use this method*** if you want to add **Distance Mate** quickly. 

## Results We Can Get

After running our macro, we successfully add **Distance Mate** a Component in an Assembly as a result.

Below image shows the result we get.

[![assembly-distance-mate](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-distance-mate/final-result-gif.gif)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-distance-mate/final-result-gif.gif)

We add **Distance Mate** in following steps in general.

1. *loop through each component in current assembly.*
2. *Loop through each face.*
3. *Get desired face from user confirmation.*
4. *Select required faces for mate.*
5. *Get distance from user.*
6. *Add Distance Mate.*
7. *Final Work*

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Ask user to confirm this selection
resp = MsgBox("Is this correct Face?", vbYesNo, "Select Face")
```

* In above line, we ask user to confirm this selection.
* We do this in following steps.
  1. Show a Message Box to user as shown below.
  
  [![user-confirmation](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-tangent-mate/user-confirmation.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-tangent-mate/user-confirmation.png)

  2. Store user response in **`resp`** variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if user response if Yes
If resp = vbYes Then

End If
```

* In above code block, we check if user response if Yes.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`resp = vbYes`**

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Add current face to List of Faces
Set vFaces(componentIndex + 1) = swFace
Exit Function
```

* When user response if **Yes**, then above code execute.
* In above line, 1st we add current face to List of Faces.
* 2nd, we exit this **`SelectFace`** function.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Get next face
Set swFace = swFace.GetNextFace
```

* In above line, we set the value of **`swFace`** variable.
* This is done by **`GetNextFace`** method of **`swFace`** variable.

### Select Faces

In this section, we *Select Faces*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Solidworks Select Data
Dim swSelData As SldWorks.SelectData
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a variable for *Solidworks Select Data*.
* **Variable Name**: `swSelData`
* **Type**: `SldWorks.SelectData`
* **Reference**: Please visit 🚀 **[online SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectData_members.html)**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set value of Solidworks Select Data variable
Set swSelData = swDoc.SelectionManager.CreateSelectData
```

* In above line, we set *value* of **`swSelData`** variable.
* Value of **`swSelData`** variable is set by **`CreateSelectData`**, which is part of **`SelectionManager`**. This **`SelectionManager`** is part of **`swDoc`** variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set Mark of Solidworks Select Data
swSelData.Mark = 1
```

* In above line, we set *Mark* of **`swSelData`** variable to **1**.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Boolean variable
Dim boolStatus As Boolean
```

* **Purpose**: In above line, we create a *Boolean variable*.
* **Variable Name**: `boolStatus`
* **Type**: `Boolean`

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Select faces for Distance mate
boolStatus = swDoc.Extension.MultiSelect2(vFaces, False, swSelData)
```

* In above line, we select Faces by **`MultiSelect2`** method.
* This **`MultiSelect2`** method takes following parameter.
  - **Objects**: *Array of selectable objects*.
  - **AppendFlag**: *`True` to append the objects to the selection list, `False` to replace the current selection list with these objects*.
  - **Data**: *🚀 **[`ISelectData`](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.ISelectData_members.html)** object, Nothing, or null*

' Check if faces are selected
If boolStatus = False Then
  MsgBox "Failed to select faces."
  swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully selected the faces.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`boolStatus = False`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to select faces.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

### Get unit Conversion factors

Now we need to get unit Conversion factors as shown in below code.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
'-----------------------Unit Conversion Factors----------------------------------------
  
' Local variables used as Conversion Factors
Dim LengthConversionFactor As Double
Dim AngleConversionFactor As Double

' Use a Select Case, to get the length of active Unit and set the different factors
Select Case swDoc.GetUnits(0)       ' GetUnits function gives us, active unit

Case swMETER    ' If length is in Meter
  LengthConversionFactor = 1
  AngleConversionFactor = 1

Case swMM       ' If length is in MM
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swCM       ' If length is in CM
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 100
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swINCHES   ' If length is in INCHES
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swFEET     ' If length is in FEET
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 * (0.0254 * 12)
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swFEETINCHES     ' If length is in FEET & INCHES
  LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254  ' For length we use sama as Inch
  AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329

Case swANGSTROM        ' If length is in ANGSTROM

' Getting Distance from user.
response = InputBox("Please Enter [Distance]:")
```

* In above line of code we are doing **2 steps** in one line.

  Those 2 steps are explained below.

  * **Step 1** - Getting **Distance** from user.

  Below image shows the message for **Distance** to the user.

  [![message-to-select-distance](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-distance-mate/message-to-select-distance.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/assembly-distance-mate/message-to-select-distance.png)

  * **Step 2** - Assigned input value to **`response`** variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' This will handle empty value or cancel case
If Len(response) = 0 Then
  MsgBox "Empty or no value. Please try again."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check the ***length of input value***.
* This check will handle **case for empty value** or **cancel operation case**.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`Len(response) = 0`**
  * **`Len()`** is pre-build VBA function which check the length of a object.
  * In above cases, we will get **0** value.
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Empty or no value. Please try again.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' This will handle case for Non-numeric values
If IsNumeric(response) = False Then
  MsgBox "Entered value is Non-numeric. Please try again."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if the *input value* is **Non-numeric**.
* This check will handle **case for Non-numeric values**.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`IsNumeric(response) = False`**
  * **`IsNumeric()`** is pre-build VBA function which check if *passing object is **Numeric** or not*.
  * In above cases, we will get **False** value.
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Entered value is Non-numeric. Please try again.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Variable for Distance
Dim distance As Double
```

* In above line, we create a variable to store Rib Thickness.
* **Variable Name**: `distance`
* **Type**: `Double`

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
distance = CDbl(response) * LengthConversionFactor
```

* In above line of code we are doing **3 steps** in one line.

  Those 3 steps are explained below.

  * **Step 1** - Converting **distance** from user to **`Double`** type.
  * **Step 2** - Updating converted distance as per document unit system.
  * **Step 3** - Assigned input value to **`distance`** variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' This will handle case for 0 distance
If distance = 0 Then
  MsgBox "Entered value must be greater than 0. Please try again."
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if the *input value* is **zero (0)**.
* This check will handle **case for 0 thickness**.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`RibThickness = 0`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Entered value must be greater than 0. Please try again.*
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

### Add Distance Mate

In this section, we add *Distance Mate*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Add Distance Mate
Set swMateFeature = swAssembly.AddMate5(swMateDISTANCE, swMateAlignANTI_ALIGNED, False, distance, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, False, False, 0, swAddMateError_ErrorUknown)
```

* In above line, we set the value of variable `swMateFeature` by `AddMate5` method.

* This `AddMate5` method takes following parameters as explained:

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Mate is added or not
If swMateFeature Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox "Failed to Add Mate."
  swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
  Exit Sub
End If
```

* In above code block, we check if we successfully added **Distance Mate** or not.
* We use 🚀 **[IF statement](/vba/vba-if-then-structure-select-case/)** for checking.
* **Condition**: **`swMateFeature Is Nothing`**
* When this condition is **`True`**, 
  * We show and 🚀 **[message window](/vba/vba-msgBox-function/)** to user.
  * **Message**: *Failed to Add Mate.
  * After that we clear the selection.
  * Then we **stop** our macro here.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we get **Distance Mate** as shown in below image.

### Final work

In this section, after adding **Distance Mate**, we have to do some cleaning work so that we can use this macro frequently.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Clear all selection
swDoc.ClearSelection2 True
```

* In above line, we clear all selection.
* For this we use `ClearSelection2` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' View zoom to fit
swDoc.ViewZoomtofit2
```

* In above line, we make our view zoom to fit the model.
* For this we use `ViewZoomtofit2` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Rebuild assembly
swDoc.ForceRebuild3 True
```

* In above line, we Rebuild assembly.
* For this we use `ForceRebuild3` method which is part of *SOLIDWORKS Document* variable i.e `swDoc` variable.

**This is it !!!**
