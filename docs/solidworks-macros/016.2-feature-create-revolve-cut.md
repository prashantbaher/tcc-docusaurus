Please note that there are **no explanation** in the video. 

**Explanation** of each line and why we write code this way is given in this post.

## Code Sample

Below is the `code` sample for creating *Revolve Cut*.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit

' Create variable for Solidworks application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
' Create variable for Solidworks document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
' Creating variable for Solidworks Feature
Dim swFeature As SldWorks.Feature
' Boolean Variable
Dim boolStatus As Boolean

' Revolve Boss/Extrude program
Sub main()

    ' Setting Solidworks variable to current application
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    
    ' Check if Solidworks is opened or not
    If swApp Is Nothing Then
        MsgBox ("Solidworks is not opened")
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' Setting Solidworks document variable to opened part document
    Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
    
    ' Check if Solidworks document is opened or not
    If swDoc Is Nothing Then

## Prerequisite

In this article there are some *prerequisite*.

We are **not** creating sketches from code but we use **existing sketch** to *create Revolve Cut* feature as shown in below picture.

[![prerequisite](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-revolve-cut/prerequisite.png)](/assets/Solidworks_Images/feature-revolve-cut/prerequisite.png)

As shown in above image, there are 1 sketch and 1 Revolve feature in our part.

- `Extrude Feature` : This is our **Extrude part** for *Revolve Cut feature.*
- `Sketch2` : This is our **profile** for *Revolve Cut feature.*

If you want to create `Sketch2` programmatically then please refer to below articles.

- For Circle ðŸ‘‰ read **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Create Circle](/solidworks-macros/create-circle)** article.


If you want to create Revolve feature programmatically then please refer to below article.

* ðŸ‘‰ **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Create Extrude/Boss](/solidworks-macros/create-extrude-feature)**

Also, we will apply checks in this article, so the code we write should be error free most of the time.

## Understanding the Code

Now let us walk through **each line** in the above code, and **understand** the meaning and purpose of every line.

I also give some ðŸ“Œ ***links*** so that you can go through them if there are anything I explained in previous articles.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
Option Explicit
```

This line forces us to define every variable we are going to use. 

For more information please visit ðŸ‘‰ **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Open new Part document](/solidworks-macros/open-new-document)** post.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create variable for SOLIDWORKS application
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swApp` and the type of this `swApp` variable is `SldWorks.SldWorks`.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create variable for SOLIDWORKS document
Dim swDoc As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
```

In this line, we create a variable which we named as `swDoc` and the type of this `swDoc` variable is `SldWorks.ModelDoc2`.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Creating variable for SOLIDWORKS Feature
Dim swFeature As SldWorks.Feature
```

In this line, we Create a variable which we named as `swFeature` and the type of this `swFeature` variable is `SldWorks.Feature`.

We create variable `swFeature` for **SOLIDWORKS Feature**.

To see methods and properties related to `Feature` object, please visit ðŸ‘‰ **[this page of SOLIDWORKS API Help](https://help.solidworks.com/2019/english/api/sldworksapi/SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks~SolidWorks.Interop.sldworks.IFeature_members.html)**

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Boolean Variable
Dim BoolStatus As Boolean
```

In this line, we create a variable named `BoolStatus` as `Boolean` object type.

***These all are our global variables.***

They are **SOLIDWORKS API Objects**.

So basically I group all the **SOLIDWORKS API Objects** in one place.

I have also place `boolean` type object at top also, because we use this variable frequently.

Thus, I have started placing it here.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Main function of our VBA program
Sub main()

End Sub
```

Next is our `Sub` procedure which has name of `main`. 

This procedure hold all the *statements (instructions)* we give to computer.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Set SOLIDWORKS variable to SOLIDWORKS application
Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
```

In this line, we set the value of our SOLIDWORKS variable `swApp`; which we define earlier; to SOLIDWORKS application.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if SOLIDWORKS is opened or not
If swApp Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("SOLIDWORKS is not opened")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an ðŸ‘‰ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if SOLIDWORKS application variable is *successfully assigned* to current SOLIDWORKS application.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Setting SOLIDWORKS document variable to opened part document
Set swDoc = swApp.ActiveDoc
```

In above line of code, we set SOLIDWORKS document `swDoc` variable to currently open part document.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if SOLIDWORKS document is opened or not
If swDoc Is Nothing Then
  MsgBox ("SOLIDWORKS document is not opened. Please open a document.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an ðŸ‘‰ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if SOLIDWORKS document `swDoc` is opened.

If SOLIDWORKS document is not opened then code execute inside the code and inform the user by a ðŸ‘‰ **[Message Window](/vba/msgBox-function/)**.

After showing message our program **exit** from here itself.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
'-----------------------BELOW IS THE SOLUTION----------------------------------------

' Local variables used as Conversion Factors
Dim LengthConversionFactor As Double
Dim AngleConversionFactor As Double

' Use a Select Case, to get the length of active Unit and set the different factors
Select Case swDoc.GetUnits(0)       ' GetUnits function gives us, active unit
  
  Case swMETER    ' If length is in Meter
    LengthConversionFactor = 1
    AngleConversionFactor = 1
  
  Case swMM       ' If length is in MM
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swCM       ' If length is in CM
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 100
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swINCHES   ' If length is in INCHES
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swFEET     ' If length is in FEET
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 * (0.0254 * 12)
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swFEETINCHES     ' If length is in FEET & INCHES
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 * 0.0254  ' For length we use sama as Inch
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swANGSTROM        ' If length is in ANGSTROM
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 10000000000#
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swNANOMETER       ' If length is in NANOMETER
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000000000
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
  
  Case swMICRON       ' If length is in MICRON
    LengthConversionFactor = 1 / 1000000
    AngleConversionFactor = 1 * 0.01745329
End Select

'----------------------------------------------------------------
```

In above line of code, we get and update unit conversion variable as per document unit.

For more detail about why we are using this code sample, please visit ðŸ‘‰ **[SOLIDWORKS Macro - Fix Unit Issue](/solidworks-macros/unit-correction/)** article.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Selecting Sketch 2
BoolStatus = swDoc.Extension.SelectByID2("Sketch2", "SKETCH", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, swSelectOption_e.swSelectOptionDefault)
```

In above line, we select the *Sketch2* by using `SelectByID2` method from `Extension` object.

For more information about selection method please visit ðŸ‘‰ **[SOLIDWORKS Macros - Selection Methods](/solidworks-macros/select-plane-from-tree)** post.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Sketch 2 selected or not
If BoolStatus = False Then
  MsgBox ("Fail to select Sketch 2.")
  Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an ðŸ‘‰ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if *Sketch 2* is selected or not .

If *Sketch 2* not selected then we execute code inside the ðŸ‘‰ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** and inform the user by a ðŸ‘‰ **[Message Window](/vba/msgBox-function/)**.

After showing message our program **exit** from here itself.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Create Revolve Cut Feature
Set swFeature = swDoc.FeatureManager.FeatureRevolve2(True, True, False, True, False, True, swEndConditions_e.swEndCondBlind, swEndConditions_e.swEndCondBlind, AngleConversionFactor * 360, 0, False, False, 0, 0, swThinWallType_e.swThinWallOneDirection, 0, 0, True, False, True)
```

In above line of code we create a *Revolve Cut feature*.

We create *Revolve Cut* by setting the value of variable `swFeature` by `FeatureRevolve` method.

`FeatureRevolve` method is part of `FeatureManager` object.

This `FeatureManager` is again part of `ModelDoc2` object.

```vb showlinenumbers showLineNumbers
' Check if Revolve Cut Feature creates or not
If swFeature Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox ("Failed to create Revolve Cut Feature.")
    Exit Sub
End If
```

In above line of code, we use an ðŸ‘‰ **[IF statement](/vba/if-then-structure-select-case/)** to check if we able to create *Revolve Cut* Feature or not.

If we failed to select then inform the user by a ðŸ‘‰ **[Message Window](/vba/msgBox-function/)**.

After showing error message our program **exit** from here itself.

Now we run the macro and after running macro we get Revolve as shown in below image.
