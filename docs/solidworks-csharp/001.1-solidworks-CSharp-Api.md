Hello,

In this section, I will write articles for **Solidworks C# API** applications.

I am not creating any **Add-in** in **SOLIDWORKS** instead I will create **WPF Application** using **[PRISM](https://prismlibrary.com/index.html) + MVVM Pattern**.

This seems a lot, but this is what is using in Software Industry.

For whom this section might be interested?

 * *Those who want to learn **WPF Application** with **Solidworks** using **Prism Library**.*

That's it!!!
