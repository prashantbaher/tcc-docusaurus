## Introduction

I am a **CAD engineer** and using **Solidworks 3D CAD Software** from ***past 8 years***.

I begin learning to programme from 2017.

Since then I learn different programming languages. Most of them are Microsoft technologies.

It is because in our job we use most of the **Microsoft** products like:

1. MS Outlook

2. MS Excel

3. MS Powerpoint

Now I have knowledge of following programming languages:

1. **Visual Basic for Application, also known as VBA**

2. **C#**

3. **C++**

I am very comfortable in **VBA** and **C#** but I am still learning **C++** programming language.

I also have some knowledge of *Excel macros* but I am **not** very good at it.

I am good at **Solidworks API** and its application in the following languages:

1. *VBA* for *creating macros* in Solidworks

2. *C#* for *Add-in* or *Standalone application* in Solidworks

3. *Visual C++* just for **fun** in Solidworks

---

## Why did I learn to programme?

In **2017**, we are using **Solidworks 2015** and **Microsoft Excel** documents for our project.

At that time, my **CAD manager** was working on *automation* of different project in **Autodesk Inventor CAD** Software using ***i-Logic***.

*By seeing him and doing this automation, I also want to do the same thing in my project also!*

I talk with my team and ask them for the suggestions but they are not much interested.

Then I watch some **YouTube Videos** and get my hands dirty with macros.

After some time I got the **confidence** and now I am able to write **macros** with accurate use *Google*.

---

## How did I learn to programme?

I know that I had to learn **VBA macro programming** for automation of tasks.

I ask for some *guidance* from my *Software developer* friends who are working on *CAD Software development* in my company.

They told me to learn about *programming basics*, *Logical thinking* and *VBA programming language*. 

For learning purpose they told me to learn from **YouTube Videos**.

Then I look for some online tutorials like **YouTube Videos** and **free online course**.

On YouTube, I got a playlist from **[Me in 3d](https://youtu.be/Pp0Kc89g7mE)**.

> *Select the link, if you want to watch those tutorials.*

I watch all the videos and then complete all the macros as given in these videos.

This gives me *confidence* but **not** the knowledge I was looking for.

*Hence I look for more resources and did not find a useful resource which can teach me macro programming step by step.*
 
At that time, my developer friends suggest me to learn about **VBA macro programming** in **Microsoft Excel**.

They told me that, both **Solidworks** and **Microsoft Excel** use macros written in *VBA programming language* and in the later stage of development I have to learn both to integrate for large complex project.

So I started searching for macro tutorials for **Microsoft Excel**.

In office, it is very difficult for me to watch all the videos and do works at the same time.

> At home, I want to spend my more time with wife who was not well at that point of time.

I thought I should look for **a Book** for this and luckily I found **a book** on Amazon which is shown below.

</div>

This is updated copy of the same book. 

If you want to buy this book you can but it from Amazon by clicking above image ad.

*Reading a book* and *working* in an office at the same time is an easy task for me.

I started working with the book and get confidence in programming.

From this book, I learnt **programming concepts** and **VBA programming language** because I was not keen on learning **Microsoft Excel macro programming** hence I did not learn it.

After learning **programming concepts** and **VBA programming language**, I started creating **Solidworks macros in VBA** programming language.

At first, I **record** macros and **try to understand every line code** for example meaning of a line, why we use it here & so on.

**Soon I know that recorded macros are not much help because it adds lots of Garbage code in it.**

At this stage, I combine the knowledge I learn from video tutorial of **Men in 3D** and knowledge I get from reading the book.

By doing this,at slow pace, I was getting good at **VBA macro programming** in **Solidworks** without much help from others.

There are some times where I need to ask for help, at that time my developer friends helped me much.
 
I learn all this much by **May 2018** and I was very ***persistent*** with that. 
Then I started creating macros for my project.

I started by **identifying the smallest tasks** to automate and **then create Solidworks VBA macro** for a particular task.

I identified some 10-15 tasks and create Solidworks VBA macros for those tasks.

In the Meantime, I also create a macro for one of my friend who saw me and asks my help.
 
After creating some **Solidworks VBA macros** I show them to my *software developer* friend in the company and he told me to create an **Add-in** in Solidworks 3D CAD Software by combining the functionality of all the macros I have created.
 
I was on learning spree hence took this task and started my journey of learning how to create add-in in Solidworks 3D CAD software.
 
Here I come across **YouTube** tutorials from **[AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube)**, **SolidDNA tutorials** and his books for **Solidworks API programming**.
 
These tutorials really helped me a lot.
 
From **[AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube)** YouTube Channel, I learnt basic **C# programming languages** as well and found it **very helpful, practical and professional**.
 
Learning **C# programming language** from his channel greatly boost my confidence.
 
After **2 months** of learning from his **[YouTube Channel](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube)**, I started creating **Add-in** in **Solidworks** with **C# programming language** along with **Window Presentation Foundation (WPF)** for modern User Interface.
 
It took me more **6 months** to create an **Solidworks C# add-in** which has all the same functionality of previously done macros.
 
**My software developer friends, my CAD manager and everybody in my team was blown away when I showed them the add-in I had created.**
 
*My work was recognised by everyone in my department which makes me very happy!!!*
 
I stopped creating more macros myself because my teams mates are doing this job for themselves.

I help them in creating **Solidworks VBA macros** and **Solidworks Standalone Application** for themselves.
 
After that, I started learning **C++ programming language** by reading books from the creator of C++ programming language ***Bjarne Stroustrup***.

Those books are shown below.

1st is very good for learning programming itself!!! 

A **must recommendation** to all those who want to learn **how to think for programming** !!

</div>

2nd book is an advance book, mainly use for ***reference*** in **C++ programming language**. 

If you want to buy these books you can but them from Amazon by clicking above image ads.
 
After reading the 1st book I thought I should start implementing my new knowledge in creating some application.

I choose **C++ programming language** and **Solidworks C++ API** for recreating what I had done previously.
 
It took me more *6-8 months* for learning **C++ programming language** and **Solidworks C++ API** but I create only **10%** of the tasks.
 
It was simply because after everyone noticed the my programming skills, I asked my developer friends to assign me some work.

So that I can learn what **actual software development process** looks like and how they do it.

Because of this, I am not able to give much time to **C++ programming language** and **Solidworks C++ API**.

But I am sure if anybody wants to start a **C++ project** for Solidworks I can really help in this.

Basically I read a lot, work a lot and practice a lot. Because of these I learn all these things.

## Purpose of this blog

Purpose of this blog is simple. 

<div class="w3-border w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-green w3-pale-green">
Share my knowledge of Solidworks VBA Macro development and provide Solidworks C# API help in a tutorial format.
</div>
Since I was sharing my knowledge with *my co-workers*, I thought why don't share this knowledge with other people who wants to learn these skills.
 
Also, I believe that everybody should have access to the knowledge they are looking for and this blog gives me the opportunity to share my knowledge around the world.
 
*And blogging is a good way to do this!!!*
 
In this blog, I write tutorial posts about VBA programming language and Solidworks VBA macro development.

I want to write these tutorials in a **beginner-friendly manner** so that those who **do not** have **programming knowledge** will not get **intimated** by this.

> *It is an easy task but it takes time to learn and master.*
 
Also, in recent time when I search for the job openings, I found that there is an increase in demand for this type of skill also.

Which really surprise me!!

This encouraged me to write more on this blog. So that more people can get help from my blog.

## Future Plans

I want to go step by step in this blog.
 
First I covered some basic on **VBA programming language** with examples but they are **basic**.
 
Currently, I am writing posts on individual **Solidworks functions** in Sketch Module.
 
I would like to proceed by covering the following modules one-by-one:
 
1. **Solidworks Sketch Module**

2. **Solidworks Part Module**

3. **Solidworks Assembly Module**

4. **Solidworks Drawing Module**
 
It will take time to create cover these modules.

I also want to explain these topics with VBA examples also.

As you can understand it is a huge task to cover all these with VBA examples so it takes time but slowly we will cover all these.
 
If you want to want to know the full list of my recommended books I have listed them in my Resouces page. Please check it also.
 
**If you like my work please share with other people also.**
 
I like the motto of ***Sharing is caring***.

Hence if you find my blog helpful then I request you to share with your friends, colleagues and other people who want to learn these sort of things.

I hope you enjoy learning from these tutorials and create macros from your own.

If you have any question you can e-mail at below given e-mail id.

I am a **CAD engineer** and working on **Solidworks** 3D Software.

In 2017, I want to *automate* my current project. So I was looking for resources for creating `VBA` macros.

I started with *recording macros* but soon I realized its limitation. Then I started looking for tutorials on creating macros from scratch.

I found some tutorials on websites but they are not much helpful.

After browsing these websites and tutorials I found that I need to learn 2 things for creating macros from scratch.

1. Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming language

2. Solidworks API help document

Now as a `mechanical engineer`, learning a programming language feels very intimidating.

In starting I did not understand what a `loop` is and why we use it for!!!

But *slowly-slowly*, I am getting it and started creating some basic macros from my own.

Honestly, for learning `VBA programming language` I take help from books on VBA macros books on `MS Excel`. 

It is because `VBA` is used in *Excel Automation* mostly, that's what in internet show!!!

After learning *some fundamentals*, I started looking on resource for Solidworks macro creation.

I found a book by Luke Malpass on Solidworks Add-in.

> You can download these books free from [AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/download/solidworks-files)

These books were a very big help to me in learning some basic to intermediate concepts of Solidworks.

I also watch [Me in 3d](https://youtu.be/Pp0Kc89g7mE) macro tutorials for learning basics of Solidworks API.

After all this **reading and watching** I started with creating macros for my projects. 

I must tell you it was not an easy task. After a large number of trials, I finally had a working macro.

It takes me around `6 months` to create a perfect working macro which my team use. After creating several macros, I get confidence in them.

After creating macros, I started for creating add-in also. This time in C# programming language.

Here, free `C#` and `SolidDna` tutorials from [AngelSix](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube) (again **Luke**) helps me completely. I watch his videos *2-3 times* and follow as shown in videos.

This helps me to learn `C#` and `add-in` programming.

I also watched `WPF tutorials` from his [YouTube](http://www.angelsix.com/youtube) channel and still following him there.

As you can see, it is a **very long journey** for me to learn macros and add-in for Solidworks.

Because of this, I thought why not share my knowledge and help those who want to learn Macro programming. 

Hence I started a blog about `VBA macro` tutorial learning.

Before this blog, I had a similar blog named [Solidworkmacrotutorials](https://solidworkmacrotutorial.blogspot.com/). 

I had to shift from [Solidworkmacrotutorials](https://solidworkmacrotutorial.blogspot.com/). It is difficult for me to write `code examples` and I don't have much control how the blog should look like.

I posted tutorials on `VBA programming` but I did not post more tutorials on `Solidworks API` there.

I gave my time in finding a suitable replacement for that blog and then I started this blog.

I hope you enjoy learning from these tutorials and create macros from your own.
